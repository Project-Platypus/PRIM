Summary: This module implements the Patient Rule Induction Method
                   (PRIM) for scenario discovery in Python.  This is a
                   standalone version of the PRIM algorithm implemented in the
                   EMA Workbench by Jan Kwakkel, which is based on the
                   sdtoolkit R package developed by RAND Corporation.  All
                   credit goes to Jan Kwakkel for developing the original code.
                   This standalone version of PRIM was created and maintained
                   by David Hadka.
